# My CODE2040 Technical Assessment
Visit the site I created to solve the problems in the assessment here: https://mandemeskel.github.io/code2040App/

This was fun, I enjoyed using AngularJS for this.
Some would say this was over engineered - I am one of those people - but this was fun - did I say that already? - and relaxing.

The assessment was centered around making a call to their API to get a the problem and sending the solution back to their API for validation.


# Stack: <br/>
HTML5 <br/>
CSS3 - media queries and transitions <br/>
JS/EMACS6 - sort of, I did use 'let' and promises XD <br/>
AngularJS - filter, factory, AJAX, services, and one very lonely controller <br/> 


Next time Python w/ Bottle?
