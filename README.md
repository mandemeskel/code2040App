# My CODE2040 Technical Assessment
Visit the site I created to solve the problems in the assessment here: https://mandemeskel.github.io/code2040App/  <br/>
You can't make the API calls necessary to see the site working because the site is hosted securely, HTTPS, while the API is using HTTP. This discrepancy makes modern browsers panic; modern browsers deny all requests to insecure, HTTP, resources while in a secure, HTTPS, environment, regardless of CORS, cross-origin resource sharing. However, you can still enjoy the magic of CSS3, just can't make API calls.

This was fun; I enjoyed using AngularJS.
Some would say this was over engineered - I'm one of those people that would say that - but this was fun - did I say that already? - and relaxing.

The assessment was centered around making a call to an API to get a problem and sending the solution back to the API for validation.



# Stack: <br/>
HTML5 <br/>
CSS3 - media queries and transitions <br/>
JS/EMACS6 - sort of, I did use 'let' and promises XD <br/>
AngularJS - filter, factory, AJAX, services, and one very lonely controller <br/> 


Next time Python w/ Bottle?
